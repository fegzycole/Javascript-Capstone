### Characters

- Hero ![screenshot](screenshots/Hero.png) main character of the game, he is on a quest to discover the hidden city.

- Mace ![screenshot](screenshots/Mace.png) certified bad boy, it moves left and right and with its sharp edges is capable of fatally wounding our hero. As you advance more in the game, you encounter more of it.

- Fire ![screenshot](screenshots/Fire.png) static but deadly, don't come too close or you won't be alive to tell the tale. Like the mace above, you encounter more of it as you advance in the game.

- Water ![screenshot](screenshots/Water.png) Who doesn't like a good ol swim? I'll tell you who, our hero doesn't, he's afraid of the water, try not to send him into the deep please, will you?

- Coins ![screenshot](screenshots/Coin.png) Shiny and sparkly, collect as much of it as you can.


### How To Play

The controls for the game are pretty basic, this was done intentionally for a better user experience

- Top arrow makes the hero jump

- Left arrow moves the hero to the left

- Right arrow moves the hero to the right

- Gravity brings the hero down, so there is no control for that.
